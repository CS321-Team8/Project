Our chrome extension serves to remind users of assignments and eliminate distractions during
working periods found in the userâ€™s calendar. While there are chrome extensions used to block
user websites and calendar apps can include reminders of events, the ability to have the two in
one, working automatically to detect when a device should be restricted to ensure higher
productivity levels, would be incredible useful and take out the work of needing to block and
unblock sites manually every time a calendar alert is received.
